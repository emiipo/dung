# DUNG

dung started off after I opened the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) about roguelike games. Something about the image below piqued my brain and I decided to make an ascii top down game of dungeon exploration (hence the name dung). I had no plans except that I want to make it using C++ & SDL.

## NOW & THEN

As of now there is not much of the game as I started really enjoying implementing my own game engine features. For now I intend to keep it all in one project but as time goes I might reuse this little engine and seperate it into it's own repo.

## TODO

Here's a little reminder for myself of things I plan to do :)

- [ ] Properly implement Events using delegates and such
- [ ] Organise the code base better (probably seperate into game & engine folders)
- [ ] Fix code style (I am really undecisive and usually vibe it out)
- [ ] Proper input handling with easily rebindable keys
- [ ] Sort out proper headers and forward declarations
- [ ] I like using std::list, but memory and iteration wise it's less performant, eventually move some of them over to std::vector
- [ ] Increase this list :)
